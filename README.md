# Difference - Objects - Classes
  In java classes are a template and blueprint for creating or instantiating objects.  Classes define the objects's attributes and behaviors.  Attributes are the data members and behaviors are the methods that the objects will have.  In regards to memory allocation, the difference between classes and objects are that classes do not occupy memory while objects do occupy memory when they are instantiated at runtime. As stated objects are instances of a class that have their own set of instance variables(field/attributes) and can invoke methods(behaviors). 
  In application a class is defined in order to describe common properties and behaviors shared by multiple objects, whereas objects are used to represent specific instances of that defined class. The example code I provided demonstrates Bikes all have shared common attributes in the form of gears however they do not all have the same exact number of gears.  Additionally they all may be bikes but might have different purposed such as the difference between BMX bikes and Mountain bikes, one has pegs while the other has shocks.  In the TestBikes.java file you can see the instantiation of the objects of these classes.
